PATH_XIUZHEN/2022-ellen.jpg,Subcytoplasmic location of translation controls protein output,"Ellen L. Horste,Mervin M. Fansler,Ting Cai,Xiuzhen Chen,Sibylle Mitschka,Gang Zhen,Flora C. Y. Lee,Jernej Ule,Christine Mayr","Molecular Cell",2023,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2022-ellen.pdf,,,,,,,,,"The cytoplasm is highly compartmentalized, but the extent and consequences of subcytopIasmic mRNA localization in non-polarized cells are largely unknown. We determined mRNA enrichment in TIS granules (TGs) and the rough endopIasmic reticuIum (ER) through particle sorting and isolated cytosolic mRNAs by digitonin extraction. When focusing on non-membrane protein-encoding mRNAs, we observed that 52% have a biased transcript distribution across these compartments. Compartment enrichment is determined by a combinatorial code based on mRNA length, exon length, and 3′UTR-bound RNA-binding proteins. Compartment-biased mRNAs differ in the functional classes of their encoded proteins: TG-enriched mRNAs encode low-abundance proteins with strong enrichment of transcription factors, whereas ER-enriched mRNAs encode large and highly expressed proteins. Compartment localization is an important determinant of mRNA and protein abundance, which is supported by reporter experiments showing that redirecting cytosolic mRNAs to the ER increases their protein expression. In summary, the cytoplasm is functionally compartmentaIized by local translation environments."

Czub,Dimitris Liakopoulos,Joerg Stelling,Michel O. Steinmetz,Yves Barral","Journal of Cell Biology",2023,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2023-JCB-Kip2.pdf<>Press Release<>https://biol.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/d-biol-news/2023/04/unlocking-the-mystery-of-microtubule-growth-the-intricate-dance-of-kip2-and-bik1.html<>Code<>https://gitlab.com/csb.ethz/kip2-bik1-manuscript/,,,,,,,,,"Kinesins are microtubule-dependent motor proteins, some of which moonlight as microtubule polymerases, such as the yeast protein Kip2. Here, we show that the CLIP-170 ortholog Bik1 stabilizes Kip2 at microtubule ends where the motor domain of Kip2 promotes microtubule polymerization. Live-cell imaging and mathematical estimation of Kip2 dynamics reveal that disrupting the Kip2-Bik1 interaction aborts Kip2 dwelling at microtubule ends and abrogates its microtubule polymerization activity. Structural modeling and biochemical experiments identify a patch of positively charged residues that enables the motor domain to bind free tubulin dimers alternatively to the microtubule shaft. Neutralizing this patch abolished the ability of Kip2 to promote microtubule growth both in vivo and in vitro without affecting its ability to walk along microtubules. Our studies suggest that Kip2 utilizes Bik1 as a cofactor to track microtubule tips, where its motor domain then recruits free tubulin and catalyzes microtubule assembly." 
PATH_XIUZHEN/2022-RNA-perspective.jpg,A working model for condensate RNA-binding proteins as matchmakers for protein complex assembly,"Xiuzhen Chen,Christine Mayr","RNA",2022,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2022-RNA-perspective.pdf,,,,,,,,,"Most cellular processes are carried out by protein complexes, but it is still largely unknown how the subunits of lowly expressed complexes find each other in the crowded cellular environment. Here, we will describe a working model where RNA-binding proteins in cytoplasmic condensates act as matchmakers between their bound proteins (called protein targets) and newly translated proteins of their RNA targets to promote their assembly into complexes. Different RNA-binding proteins act as scaffolds for various cytoplasmic condensates with several of them supporting translation. mRNAs and proteins are recruited into the cytoplasmic condensates through binding to specific domains in the RNA-binding proteins. Scaffold RNA-binding proteins have a high valency. In our model, they use homotypic interactions to assemble condensates and they use heterotypic interactions to recruit protein targets into the condensates. We propose that unoccupied binding sites in the scaffold RNA-binding proteins transiently retain recruited and newly translated proteins in the condensates, thus promoting their assembly into complexes. Taken together, we propose that lowly expressed subunits of protein complexes combine information in their mRNAs and proteins to colocalize in the cytoplasm. The efficiency of protein complex assembly is increased by transient entrapment accomplished by multivalent RNA-binding proteins within cytoplasmic condensates." 
PATH_XIUZHEN/2019-elife-Kip2.png,Remote control of microtubule plus-end dynamics and function from the minus-end,"Xiuzhen Chen,Lukas A. Widmer,Marcel M. Stangier,Michel O. Steinmetz,Joerg Stelling,Yves Barral","Elife",2019,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2019-elife-Kip2.pdf<>Code<>https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Kip2-SPB-Profile-Manuscript,,,,,,,,,"In eukaryotes, the organization and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton depend on the allocation of different roles to individual microtubules. For example, many asymmetrically dividing cells differentially specify microtubule behavior at old and new centrosomes. Here we show that yeast spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast centrosomes) differentially control the plus-end dynamics and cargoes of their astral microtubules, remotely from the minus-end. The old SPB recruits the kinesin motor protein Kip2, which then translocates to the plus-end of the emanating microtubules, promotes their extension and delivers dynein into the bud. Kip2 recruitment at the SPB depends on Bub2 and Bfa1, and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Kip2 prevents random lattice binding. Releasing Kip2 of its control by SPBs equalizes its distribution, the length of microtubules and dynein distribution between the mother cell and its bud. These observations reveal that microtubule organizing centers use minus to plus-end directed remote control to individualize microtubule function."

Steinmetz","Structure",2018,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2018-Structure-Bik1-Bim1.pdf<>Supplemental Information<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2018-Structure-Bik1-Bim1-supplement.pdf,,,,,,,,,"In budding yeast, the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins Bik1 (CLIP-170) and Bim1 (EB1) form a complex that interacts with partners involved in spindle positioning, including Stu2 and Kar9. Here, we show that the CAP-Gly and coiled-coil domains of Bik1 interact with the C-terminal ETF peptide of Bim1 and the C-terminal tail region of Stu2, respectively. The crystal structures of the CAP-Gly domain of Bik1 (Bik1CG) alone and in complex with an ETF peptide revealed unique, functionally relevant CAP-Gly elements, establishing Bik1CG as a specific C-terminal phenylalanine recognition domain. Unlike the mammalian CLIP-170-EB1 complex, Bik1-Bim1 forms ternary complexes with the EB1-binding motifs SxIP and LxxPTPh, which are present in diverse proteins, including Kar9. Perturbation of the Bik1-Bim1 interaction in vivo affected Bik1 localization and astral microtubule length. Our results provide insight into the role of the Bik1-Bim1 interaction for cell division, and demonstrate that the CLIP-170-EB1 module is evolutionarily flexible." 
PATH_XIUZHEN/2018-MBoC-spatialcues.png,Spatial cues and not spindle pole maturation drive the asymmetry of astral microtubules between new and preexisting spindle poles,"Jette Lengefeld,Eric Yen,Xiuzhen Chen,Allen Leary,Jackie Vogel,Yves Barral","Molecular Biology of the Cell",2018,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2018-MBoC-spatialcues.pdf<>Supplemental Information<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2018-MBoC-spatialcues-supplement.pdf,,,,,,,,,"In many asymmetrically dividing cells, the microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs; mammalian centrosome and yeast spindle pole body [SPB]) nucleate more astral microtubules on one of the two spindle poles than the other. This differential activity generally correlates with the age of MTOCs and contributes to orienting the mitotic spindle within the cell. The asymmetry might result from the two MTOCs being in distinctive maturation states. We investigated this model in budding yeast. Using fluorophores with different maturation kinetics to label the outer plaque components of the SPB, we found that the Cnm67 protein is mobile, whereas Spc72 is not. However, these two proteins were rapidly as abundant on both SPBs, indicating that SPBs mature more rapidly than anticipated. Superresolution microscopy confirmed this finding for Spc72 and for the γ-tubulin complex. Moreover, astral microtubule number and length correlated with the subcellular localization of SPBs rather than their age. Kar9-dependent orientation of the spindle drove the differential activity of the SPBs in astral microtubule organization rather than intrinsic differences between the spindle poles. Together, our data establish that Kar9 and spatial cues, rather than the kinetics of SPB maturation, control the asymmetry of astral microtubule organization between the preexisting and new SPBs." 
PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-EMBOreports.png,Symmetrical modification within a nucleosome is not required globally for histone lysine methylation,"Xiuzhen Chen,Jun Xiong,Mo Xu,She Chen,Bing Zhu","EMBO reports",2011,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-EMBOreports.pdf,,,,,,,,,"Two copies of each core histone exist in every nucleosome; however, it is not known whether both histones within a nucleosome are required to be symmetrically methylated at the same lysine residues. We report that for most lysine methylation states, wild-type histones paired with mutant, unmethylatable histones in mononucleosomes have comparable methylation levels to bulk histones. Our results indicate that symmetrical histone methylation is not required on a global scale. However, wild-type H4 histones paired with unmethylatable H4K20R histones showed reduced levels of H4K20me2 and H4K20me3, suggesting that some fractions of these modifications might exist symmetrically, and enzymes mediating these modifications might, to some extent, favour nucleosome substrates with premethylated H4K20."

PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-science.png,Partitioning of histone H3-H4 tetramers during DNA replication-dependent chromatin assembly,"Mo Xu,Chengzu Long,Xiuzhen Chen,Chang Huang,She Chen,Bing Zhu","Science",2010,Paper<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-science.pdf<>Perspective<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-science-perspective.pdf<>Supplemental Information<>PATH_XIUZHEN/2011-science-supplement.pdf,,,,,,,,,"Semiconservative DNA replication ensures the faithful duplication of genetic information during cell divisions. However, how epigenetic information carried by histone modifications propagates through mitotic divisions remains elusive. To address this question, the DNA replication–dependent nucleosome partition pattern must be clarified. Here, we report significant amounts of H3.3-H4 tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1-H4 tetramers remained intact. Inhibiting DNA replication–dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting events, which suggests that (i) the replication-independent H3.3 deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating two new H3.3-H4 dimers and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred during replication-dependent deposition. Our results support the idea that “silent” histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events."
