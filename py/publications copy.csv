We build on the underlying theory of the well-known tetgen software, but use a floating-point implementation based on indirect geometric predicates to implicitly represent Steiner points: this new approach dramatically simplifies the implementation, removing the need for ad-hoc tolerances in geometric operations. Our approach leads to a robust and parameter-free implementation, with an empirically manageable number of added Steiner points. Furthermore, our algorithm addresses a major gap in tetgen’s theory which may lead to algorithmic failure on valid models, even when assuming perfect precision in the calculations. Our output tetrahedrization conforms with the input geometry without approximations. We can further round our output to floating-point coordinates for downstream applications, which almost always results in valid floating-point meshes unless the input triangulation is very close to being degenerate."

Developing large subject-specific population models is challenging and requires extensive manual effort. Thus, the anatomical representations are often subjected to simplification. The discretized geometries do not guarantee conformity in shared interfaces, leading to complications in setting up simulations. Additionally, these models are not openly accessible, challenging reproducibility. Our work provides multiple subject-specific hip joint finite element models and a novel semi-automated modeling workflow. Methods: we reconstruct 11 healthy subject-specific models, including the sacrum, the paired pelvic bones, the paired proximal femurs, the paired hip joints, the paired sacroiliac joints, and the pubic symphysis. The bones are derived from CT scans, and the cartilages are generated from the bone geometries. We generate the whole complex’s volume mesh with conforming interfaces. Our models are evaluated using both mesh quality metrics and simulation experiments. Results: the geometry of all the models are inspected by our clinical expert and show high-quality discretization with accurate geometries. The simulations produce smooth stress patterns, and the variance among the subjects highlights the effect of inter-subject variability and asymmetry in the predicted results. Conclusions: our work is one of the largest model repositories with respect to the number of subjects and regions of interest in the hip joint area. Our detailed research data, including the clinical images, the segmentation label maps, the finite element models, and software tools, are openly accessible on GitHub and the link is provided in Moshfeghifar et al.(2022)[1]. Our aim is to empower clinical researchers to have free access to verified and reproducible models. In future work, we aim to add additional structures to our models."

Previous methods guarantee only one of the two. Local injectivity is required to enable these parametrizations’ use in applications such as surface quadrangulation and spline construction. Holonomy control is crucial to enable guidance or prescription of the parametrization’s isocurves based on directional information, in particular from cross-fields or feature curves, and more generally to constrain the parametrization topologically. To this end we investigate the relation between cross-field topology and seamless parametrization topology. Leveraging previous results on locally injective parametrization and combining them with insights on this relation in terms of holonomy, we propose an algorithm that meets these requirements. A key component relies on the insight that arbitrary surface cut graphs, as required for global parametrization, can be homeomorphically modified to assume almost any set of turning numbers with respect to a given target cross-field"

Our approach is the first that scales to massive point clouds by fusing distance-to-feature estimates obtained on individual patches.We extensively evaluate our approach against related state-of-the-art methods on newly proposed synthetic and real-world 3D CAD model benchmarks. Our approach not only outperforms these (with improvements in Recall and False Positives Rates), but generalizes to real-world scans after training our model on synthetic data and fine-tuning it on a small dataset of scanned data.

State-of-the-art finite element studies on human jaws are mostly limited to the geometry of a single patient. In general, developing accurate patient-specific computational models of the human jaw acquired from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is labor-intensive and non-trivial, which involves time-consuming human-in-the-loop procedures, such as segmentation, geometry reconstruction, and re-meshing tasks. Therefore, with the current practice, researchers need to spend considerable time and effort to produce finite element models (FEMs) to get to the point where they can use the models to answer clinically-interesting questions. Besides, any manual task involved in the process makes it difficult for the researchers to reproduce identical models generated in the literature. Hence, a quantitative comparison is not attainable due to the lack of surface/volumetric meshes and FEMs. Methods. We share an open-access repository composed of 17 patient-specific computational models of human jaws and the utilized pipeline for generating them for reproducibility of our work. The used pipeline minimizes the required time for processing and any potential biases in the model generation process caused by human intervention. It gets the segmented geometries with irregular and dense surface meshes and provides reduced, adaptive, watertight, and conformal surface/volumetric meshes, which can directly be used in finite element (FE) analysis. Results. We have quantified the variability of our 17 models and assessed the accuracy of the developed models from three different aspects; (1) the maximum deviations from the input meshes using the Hausdorff distance as an error measurement, (2) the quality of the developed volumetric meshes, and (3) the stability of the FE models under two different scenarios of tipping and biting. Conclusions. The obtained results indicate that the developed computational models are precise, and they consist of quality meshes suitable for various FE scenarios. We believe the provided dataset of models including a high geometrical variation obtained from 17 different models will pave the way for population studies focusing on the biomechanical behavior of human jaws."

We show that our approach scales to large problems and can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude on CPUs and three orders of magnitude on GPUs, compared to a set of manually optimized CPU baselines. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we employ it to optimize popular algorithms with applications to physical simulation and interactive mesh deformation."

Although the force-generating machinery is known, it is unknown how tissues exert physical stresses on their substrate to generate motion in vivo. Here, we identify the force transmission machinery, the substrate and the stresses that a tissue, the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, generates during its migration. We find that the primordium couples actin flow through integrins to the basement membrane for forward movement. Talin- and integrin-mediated coupling is required for efficient migration, and its loss is partially compensated for by increased actin flow. Using Embryogram, an approach to measure stresses in vivo, we show that the rear of the primordium exerts higher stresses than the front, which suggests that this tissue pushes itself forward with its back. This unexpected strategy probably also underlies the motion of other tissues in animals."

The popularity of FEM led to the development of a large family of variants, most of which require a tetrahedral or hexahedral mesh to construct the basis. While the theoretical properties of FEM basis (such as convergence rate, stability, etc.) are well understood under specific assumptions on the mesh quality,  their practical performance, influenced \emph{both} by the choice of the basis construction and quality of mesh generation, have not been systematically documented for large collections of automatically meshed 3D geometries. We introduce a set of benchmark problems involving most commonly solved \revisionn{elliptic} PDEs, starting from simple cases with an analytical solution, moving to commonly used test problem setups, and using manufactured solutions for thousands of real-world, automatically meshed geometries. For all these cases, we use state-of-the-art meshing tools to create both tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes, and compare the performance of different element types for common elliptic PDEs. The goal of his benchmark is to enable comparison of complete FEM pipelines, from mesh generation to algebraic solver, and exploration of relative impact of different factors on the overall system performance. As a specific application of our geometry and benchmark dataset, we explore the question of relative advantages of unstructured (triangular/tetrahedral) and structured (quadrilateral/hexahedral) discretizations.  We observe that for Lagrange-type elements, while linear tetrahedral elements perform poorly, quadratic tetrahedral elements perform equally well or outperform hexahedral elements for our set of problems and currently available mesh generation algorithms. This observation suggests that for common problems in  structural analysis, thermal analysis, and low Reynolds number flows, high-quality results can be obtained with unstructured tetrahedral meshes, which can be created robustly and automatically. We release the description of the benchmark problems, meshes, and reference implementation of our testing infrastructure to enable statistically significant comparisons between different FE methods, which we hope will be helpful in the development of new meshing and FEA techniques."

Our method does not have numerical parameters to tune, has a performance comparable to efﬁcient approximate algorithms, and is exact. We test our approach on a large collection of synthetic tests and real simulations, and we demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into existing simulators."

A plethora of approaches have been introduced targeting different applications and regimes; these methods vary in space discretization, choice of time integration scheme, or reduction of the non-linear equations to a sequence of simpler problems. While the theoretical properties of most of these variants are known, it is still difficult to pick the best option for a given problem, as practical performance of these methods has never been systematically compared over a varied set of geometries and boundary conditions. We introduce a collection of benchmark problems in 2D and 3D (geometry description and boundary conditions), including simple cases with known analytic solution, classical experimental setups, and complex geometries with fabricated solutions for evaluation of numerical schemes for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in laminar flow regime. We compare the performance of a representative selection of most broadly used algorithms for Navier-Stokes equations on this set of problems. Where applicable, we compare the most common spatial discretization choices (un- structured triangle/tetrahedral meshes and structured or semi-structured quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes). The study shows that while the type of spatial discretization used has a minor impact on the accuracy of the solutions, the choice of time integration method, spatial discretization order, and the choice of solving the coupled equations or reducing them to simpler subproblems have very different properties. Methods that are directly solving the original equations tend to be more accurate than splitting approaches for the same number of degrees of freedom, but numerical or computational difficulty arise when they are scaled to larger problem sizes. Low-order splitting methods are less accurate, but scale more easily to large problems, while higher-order splitting methods are accurate but require dense time discretizations to be stable. We release the description of the experiments and an implementation of our benchmark, which we believe will enable statistically significant comparisons with the state of the art as new approaches for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are introduced."

Examples of which include furniture joints, construction set assemblies, certain types of prosthetic devices and many other. To enable this optimization, we present a framework supporting robust and accurate optimization of a number of important functionals, while enforcing constraints essential for assembly functionality: weight, stress, difficulty of putting the assembly together, and how reliably it stays together. Our framework is based on smoothed formulation of elasticity equations with contact, analytically derived shape derivatives, and robust remeshing to enable large changes of shape, and at the same time, maintain accuracy.

With these smooth IGA bases, each element can be sampled into a high order element of arbitrary order while maintaining consistently continuous and smooth interfaces between elements. Several ﬁtting algorithms are developed to adjust the IGA control points to ensure the ﬁnal mesh interpolates or approximates the initial boundary closely. Our method requires no CAD geometry of the initial mesh and guarantee C 1 smoothness in regular regions and C 0 continuity across interfaces of spline-incompatible elements. The method is compared with an elastic analogy based approach and is shown to be superior in terms of computational performance and overall mesh quality and smoothness.

In the local phase, we train a neural network to learn a coherent normal direction per patch (i.e., consistently oriented normals within a single patch). In the global phase, we propagate the orientation across all coherent patches using a dipole propagation. Our dipole propagation decides to orient each patch using the electric field defined by all previously orientated patches. This gives rise to a global propagation that is stable, as well as being robust to nearby surfaces, holes, sharp features and noise."

We use the benchmark to evaluate the accuracy, correctness, and efficiency of state-of-the-art continuous collision detection algorithms, both with and without minimal separation. We discover that, despite the widespread use of CCD algorithms, existing algorithms are either: (1) correct but impractically slow, (2) efficient but incorrect, introducing false negatives which will lead to interpenetration, or (3) correct but over conservative, reporting a large number of false positives which might lead to inaccuracies when integrated in a simulator. By combining the seminal interval root finding algorithm introduced by Snyder in 1992 with modern predicate design techniques, we propose a simple and efficient CCD algorithm. This algorithm is competitive with state of the art methods in terms of runtime while conservatively reporting the time of impact and allowing explicit trade off between runtime efficiency and number of false positives reported."

Many textures combine visual and tactile aspects, each serving important purposes; most obviously, a texture alters the object’s appearance or tactile feeling as well as serving for visual or tactile identification and improving usability. The tactile feel and visual appearance of objects are often linked, but they may interact in unpredictable ways. Advances in high-resolution 3D printing enable highly flexible control of geometry to permit manipulation of both visual appearance and tactile properties. In this paper, we propose an optimization method to independently control the tactile properties and visual appearance of a texture. Our optimization is enabled by neural network-based models, and allows the creation of textures with a desired tactile feeling while preserving a desired visual appearance at a relatively low computational cost, for use in a variety of applications."

However, the space of directly millable shapes is limited since a 3-axis mill can only carve a heightfield (HF) surface during each milling and their size is bounded by the slab dimensions, one of which, the height, is typically significantly smaller than the other two for many typical materials. Extending 3-axis milling of precut slabs to general arbitrarily-sized shapes requires decomposing them into bounded-height 3-axis millable parts, or slices, which can be individually milled and then assembled to form the target object. We present DHFSlicer, a novel decomposition method that satisfies the above constraints and significantly reduces both milling time and material waste compared to alternative approaches. We satisfy the fabrication constraints by partitioning target objects into double height-field (DHF) slices, which can be fabricated using two milling passes: the HF surface accessible from one side is milled first, the slice is then flipped using appropriate fixtures, and then the second, remaining, HF surface is milled. DHFSlicer uses an efficient coarse-to-fine decomposition process: It first partitions the inputs into maximally coarse blocks that satisfy a local DHF criterion with respect to per-block milling axes, and then cuts each block into well-sized DHF slices. It minimizes milling time and material waste by keeping the slice count small, and maximizing slice height. We validate our method by embedding it within an end-to-end DHF milling pipeline and fabricating objects from slabs of foam, wood, and MDF; demonstrate that using the obtained slices reduces milling time and material waste by 42% on average compared to existing automatic alternatives; and highlight the benefits of DHFSlicer via extensive ablation studies."

One important application of complex fine-scale geometric structures is to create variable effective elastic material properties in shapes manufactured from a single material. Modification of material properties has a variety of uses, from aerospace applications to soft robotics and prosthetic devices. Due to its scalability and effectiveness, an increasingly common approach to creating spatially varying materials is to partition a shape into cells and use a parametric family of small-scale geometric structures with known effective properties to fill the cells. We propose a new approach to solving this problem for extruded, planar microstructures. Differently from existing methods for two-scale optimization based on regular grids with square periodic cells, which cannot conform to an arbitrary boundary, we introduce cell decompositions consisting of (nearly) rhombic cells. These meshes have far greater flexibility than those with square cells in terms of approximating arbitrary shapes, and, at the same time, have a number of properties simplifying small-scale structure construction. Our main contributions include a new family of 2D cell geometry structures, explicitly parameterized by their effective Young’s moduli 𝐸, Poisson’s ratios 𝜈, and rhombic angle 𝛼 with the geometry parameters expressed directly as smooth spline functions of 𝐸, 𝜈, and 𝛼. This family leads to smooth transitions between the tiles and can handle a broad range of rhombic cell shapes. We introduce a complete material design pipeline based on this microstructure family, composed of an algorithm to generate rhombic tessellation from quadrilateral meshes and an algorithm to synthesize the microstructure geometry. We fabricated a number of models and experimentally demonstrated how our method, in combination with material optimization, can be used to achieve the desired deformation behavior."

Our approach makes it possible to maintain a valid floating-point tetrahedral mesh at all algorithmic stages, eliminating the need for costly constructions with rational numbers used by TetWild, while maintaining full robustness and similar output quality. This allows us to improve on TetWild in two ways. First, our algorithm is significantly faster, with running time comparable to less robust Delaunaybased tetrahedralization algorithms. Second, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce a valid tetrahedral mesh with floating-point vertex coordinates, while TetWild produces a valid mesh with rational coordinates which is not guaranteed to be valid after floating-point conversion. As a trade-off, our algorithm no longer guarantees that all input triangles are present in the output mesh, but in practice, as confirmed by our tests on the Thingi10k dataset, the algorithm always succeeds in inserting all input triangles."

Modeling and predictive computation of these phenomena for solid mechanics is important to every discipline concerned with the motion of mechanical systems, including engineering and animation. Nevertheless, efficiently time-stepping accurate and consistent simulations of real-world contacting elastica remains an outstanding computational challenge. To model the complex interaction of deforming solids in contact we propose Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) -- a new model and algorithm for variationally solving implicitly time-stepped nonlinear elastodynamics. IPC maintains an intersection- and inversion-free trajectory regardless of material parameters, time step sizes, impact velocities, severity of deformation, or boundary conditions enforced. Constructed with a custom nonlinear solver, \IPC enables efficient resolution of time-stepping problems with separate, user-exposed accuracy tolerances that allow independent specification of the physical accuracy of the dynamics and the geometric accuracy of surface-to-surface conformation.  This enables users to decouple, as needed per application, desired accuracies for a simulation's dynamics and geometry. The resulting time stepper solves contact problems that are intersection-free (and thus robust), inversion-free, efficient (at speeds comparable to or faster than available methods that lack both convergence and feasibility), and accurate (solved to user-specified accuracies). To our knowledge this is the first implicit time-stepping method, across both the engineering and graphics literature that can consistently enforce these guarantees as we vary simulation parameters. In an extensive comparison of available simulation methods, research libraries and commercial codes we confirm that available engineering and computer graphics methods, while each succeeding admirably in custom-tuned regimes, often fail with instabilities, egregious constraint violations and/or inaccurate and implausible solutions, as we vary input materials, contact numbers and time step. We also exercise IPC across a wide range of existing and new benchmark tests and demonstrate its accurate solution over a broad sweep of reasonable time-step sizes and beyond (up to $h=2$s) across challenging large-deformation, large-contact stress-test scenarios with meshes composed of up to 2.3M tetrahedra and processing up to 498K contacts per time step. For applications requiring high-accuracy we demonstrate tight convergence on all measures.  While, for applications requiring lower accuracies, e.g. animation, we confirm IPC can ensure feasibility and plausibility even when specified tolerances are lowered for efficiency. "

Most previous work can generate either only ribs or only variable- thickness walls. However, in the general case, neither approach by itself will provide optimal solutions. By using a more precise volume model, our method is capable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitative behaviors: from ribs to walls, and smoothly transitioning in between. Our method includes new algorithms for determining the layout of reinforcement structure elements, and an efficient algorithm to optimize their shape, minimizing a non-linear non-convex functional at a fraction of the cost and with better optimality compared to standard solvers. We demonstrate the optimization results for a variety of shapes, and the improvements it yields in the strength of 3D-printed objects."

As a result, produced parts exhibit a so-called staircase effect, which results from sampling slanted surfaces with parallel planes. Using thinner slices reduces this effect, but it always remains visible where layers almost align with the input surfaces. In this research we exploit the ability of some additive manufacturing processes to deposit material slightly out of plane to dramatically reduce these artifacts. We focus in particular on the widespread Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology, since most printers in this category can deposit along slightly curved paths, under deposition slope and thickness constraints. Our algorithm curves the layers, making them either follow the natural slope of the input surface or on the contrary, make them intersect the surfaces at a steeper angle thereby improving the sampling quality. Rather than directly computing curved layers, our algorithm optimizes for a deformation of the model which is then sliced with a standard planar approach. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to encode all fabrication constraints, including the guarantee of generating collision-free toolpaths, in a convex optimization that can be solved using a QP solver.

We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometric prior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural network representing a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloud using the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointly fitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, while enforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By sampling this atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximating the input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data or explicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkably well: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharp features closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometric prior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp features and smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our method with a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surface reconstruction benchmark."

We use a well-established boundary integral formulation with spectral Galerkin method to solve the fluid flow. The key idea is to ensure an interference-free particle configuration by introducing explicit contact constraints into the system. While such constraints are typically unnecessary in the formulation they make it possible to eliminate catastrophic loss of accuracy in the discretized problem by preventing contact explicitly. The incorporation of contact constraints results in a significant increase in stable time-step size for locally-implicit time-stepping and a reduction in the necessary number of discretization points for stability. Our method maintains the accuracy of previous methods at a significantly lower cost for dense suspensions and the time step size is independent from the volume fraction. Our method permits simulations with high volume fractions; we report results with up to 60% volume fraction. We demonstrated the parallel scaling of the algorithms on up to 16K CPU cores."

Our method takes into account the geometry of a collection of key poses in one-to-one correspondence or even an entire animation sequence. From this input, on a common computational domain, an extremal metric is computed that captures the local worst case behavior in terms of distortion as the object undergoes deformation. An anisotropic, non-uniformly sized quad mesh is then generated based on this metric. This mesh avoids undersampling when deformed into any of the poses specified in the input and thus reduces artifacts. Hence, in contrast to previous approaches which target static geometry, our method aims to optimize the mesh's adaptation to the shape for every pose expected during animation or deformation rather than for one specific reference state."

A common approach is to prescribe the parametric domain structure, in particular the locations of parametrization singularities (cones), and solve a non-convex optimization problem minimizing a distortion measure, with local injectivity imposed through either constraints or barrier terms. In both cases, an initial valid parametrization is essential to serve as feasible starting point for obtaining an optimized solution. While convexified versions of the constraints eliminate this initialization requirement, they narrow the range of solutions, causing some problem instances that actually do have a solution to become infeasible. We demonstrate that for arbitrary given sets of topologically admissible parametric cones with prescribed curvature, a global seamless parametrization always exists (with the exception of one well-known case). Importantly, our proof is constructive and directly leads to a general algorithm for computing such parametrizations. Most distinctively, this algorithm is bootstrapped with a convex optimization problem (solving for a conformal map), in tandem with a simple linear equation system (determining a seamless modification of this map). This initial map can then serve as valid starting point and be optimized with respect to application specific distortion measures using existing injectivity preserving methods."

The first two factors are easy to control, while controlling element shape quality is a challenge, with fundamental limitations on what can be achieved. We propose to use p-refinement (increasing element degree) to decouple the approximation error of the finite element method from the domain mesh quality for elliptic PDEs. Our technique produces an accurate solution even on meshes with badly shaped elements, with a slightly higher running time due to the higher cost of high-order elements. We demonstrate that it is able to automatically adapt the basis to badly shaped elements, ensuring an error consistent with high-quality meshing, without any per-mesh parameter tuning. Our construction reduces to traditional fixed-degree FEM methods on high-quality meshes with identical performance. Our construction decreases the burden on meshing algorithms, reducing the need for often expensive mesh optimization and automatically compensates for badly shaped elements, which are present due to boundary constraints or limitations of current meshing methods. By tackling mesh generation and finite element simulation jointly, we obtain a pipeline that is both more efficient and more robust than combinations of existing state of the art meshing and FEM algorithms."

The quality of the resulting mesh is a direct function of the target mesh size and allowed tolerance: increasing allowed deviation from the initial mesh and decreasing the target edge length both lead to higher mesh quality.

Roughness is a major identifier for judgments of material composition, comfort, and friction and is tied closely to manual dexterity. Some attention has been given to the study of roughness perception in the past, but it has typically focused on noncontrollable natural materials or on a narrow range of artificial materials. The advent of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) printing technology provides the ability to fabricate arbitrary 3D textures with precise surface geometry to be used in tactile studies. We used parametric modeling and 3D printing to manufacture a set of textured plates with defined element spacing, shape, and arrangement. Using active touch and two-alternative forced-choice protocols, we investigated the contributions of these surface parameters to roughness perception in human subjects. Results indicate that large spatial periods produce higher estimations of roughness (with Weber fraction_=_0.19), small texture elements are perceived as rougher than large texture elements of the same wavelength, perceptual differences exist between textures with the same spacing but different arrangements, and roughness equivalencies exist between textures differing along different parameters. We posit that papillary ridges serve as tactile processing units, and neural ensembles encode the spatial profiles of the texture contact area to produce roughness estimates. The stimuli and the manufacturing process may be used in further studies of tactile roughness perception and in related neurophysiological applications."

We use a well-established boundary integral formulation for the problem as the foundation of our approach. This type of formulation, with a high-order spatial discretization and an implicit and adaptive time discretization, have been shown to be able to handle complex interactions between particles with high accuracy. Yet, for dense suspensions, very small time-steps or expensive implicit solves as well as a large number of discretization points are required to avoid non-physical contact and intersections between particles, leading to infinite forces and numerical instability. Our method maintains the accuracy of previous methods at a significantly lower cost for dense suspensions. The key idea is to ensure interference-free configuration by introducing explicit contact constraints into the system. While such constraints are unnecessary in the formulation, in the discrete form of the problem, they make it possible to eliminate catastrophic loss of accuracy by preventing contact explicitly. Introducing contact constraints results in a significant increase in stable time-step size for explicit time-stepping, and a reduction in the number of points adequate for stability."

At the same time, the low cost of introducing geometric complexity suggests the alternative of controlling the elastic material properties by producing microstructures, which can achieve behaviors significantly differing from the solid printing material. While promising results have been obtained in this direction, fragility is a significant problem blocking practical applications, especially for achieving soft material properties: due to stress concentrations at thin joints, deformations and repeated loadings are likely to cause fracture. We present a set of methods to minimize stress concentrations in microstructures by evolving their shapes. First, we demonstrate that the worst-case stress analysis problem (maximizing a stress measure over all possible unit loads) has an exact solution for periodic microstructures. We develop a new, accurate discretization of the shape derivative for stress objectives and introduce a low-dimensional parametric shape model for microstructures. This model supports robust minimization of maximal stress (approximated by an Lp norm with high p) and an efficient implementation of printability constraints. In addition to significantly reducing stresses (by a typical factor of 5X), the new method substantially expands the range of effective material properties covered by the collection of structures."

Conversion of an input surface into such a representation is commonly achieved by constructing a global seamless parametrization, possibly aligned to a guiding cross-field (e.g. of principal curvature directions), and using this parametrization as domain to construct the spline-based surface. One major fundamental difficulty in designing robust algorithms for this task is the fact that for common types, e.g. subdivision surfaces (requiring a conforming domain mesh) or T-spline surfaces (requiring a globally consistent knot interval assignment) reliably obtaining a suitable parametrization that has the same topological structure as the guiding field poses a major challenge. Even worse, not all fields do admit suitable parametrizations, and no concise conditions are known as to which fields do. We present a class of surface constructions (T-splines with halfedge knots) and a class of parametrizations (seamless similarity maps) that are, in a sense, a perfect match for the task: for any given guiding field structure, a compatible parametrization of this kind exists and a smooth piecewise rational surface with exactly the same structure as the input field can be constructed from it. As a byproduct, this enables full control over extraordinary points. The construction is backward compatible with classical NURBS. We present efficient algorithms for building discrete conformal similarity maps and associated T-meshes and T-spline surfaces."

Despite offering excellent sample complexity and built-in invariances, intrinsic geometry alone is invariant to isometric deformations, making it unsuitable for many applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose several upgrades to GNNs to leverage extrinsic differential geometry properties of three-dimensional surfaces, increasing its modeling power. In particular, we propose to exploit the Dirac operator, whose spectrum detects principal curvature directions --- this is in stark contrast with the classical Laplace operator, which directly measures mean curvature. We coin the resulting model the \emph{Surface Network (SN)}. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SNs on two challenging tasks: temporal prediction of mesh deformations under non-linear dynamics and generative models using a variational autoencoder framework with encoders/decoders given by SNs."

Relying solely on point evaluations of the underlying kernel, our scheme is essentially PDE-independent; in particular, no analytic expansion nor addition theorem is required. Moreover, it applies to boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular, and hypersingular kernels. Our work builds upon quadrature by expansion, which approximates the potential by an analytic expansion in the neighborhood of each expansion center. In contrast, we use a sum of fundamental solutions lying on a ring enclosing the neighborhood, and solve a small dense linear system for their coefficients to match the potential on a smaller concentric ring. We test the new method with Laplace, Helmholtz, Yukawa, Stokes, and Navier (elastostatic) kernels in two dimensions (2D) using adaptive, panel-based boundary quadratures on smooth and corner domains. Advantages of the algorithm include its relative simplicity of implementation, immediate extension to new kernels, dimension-independence (allowing simple generalization to 3D), and compatibility with fast algorithms such as the kernel-independent FMM."

This is particularly true for recent parametrization-based meshing approaches, where this directly translates into a shape-aware edge flow, better approximation quality, and reduced meshing artifacts. Existing methods to influence a parametrization based on principal curvature directions suffer from scale-dependence, which implies the necessity of parameter variation, or try to capture complex directional shape features using simple 1D curves. Especially for non-sharp features, such as chamfers, fillets, blends, and even more for organic variants thereof, these abstractions can be unfit. We present a novel approach which respects and exploits the 2D nature of such directional features, detects them based on coherence and homogeneity properties, and controls the parametrization process accordingly. This approach enables us to provide an intuitive, scale-invariant control parameter to the user. It also allows us to consider non-local aspects like the topology of a feature, enabling further improvements. We demonstrate that, compared to previous approaches, global parametrizations of higher quality can be generated without user intervention."

Joints implement a    vocabulary of simple constrained motions (kinematic pairs) that can be used to build more complex    behaviors.  Defining physically correct joint geometry is crucial both for realistic appearance of models   during motion, as these are typically  the only parts of geometry that stay in contact, and for    fabrication.  Direct design of joint geometry often requires more effort  than the design of the rest of    the object geometry, as it requires design of components that stay in precise contact, are aligned with    other parts,  and allow the desired range of motion. We present an interactive system for creating    physically realizable joints with user-controlled appearance.  Our system minimizes or, in most cases,    completely eliminates  the need for the user to manipulate low-level geometry of joints. This is achieved    by  automatically inferring a small number of plausible combinations of  joint dimensions,  placement and   orientation from part geometry, with the user making the final high-level selection based  on object   semantic.  Through user studies, we demonstrate that functional results with a satisfying appearance can   be obtained quickly by users with minimal modeling experience, offering a significant  improvement in the   time required for joint construction, compared to standard modeling approaches."

One of the main motivations for this work is to study the dynamics of fiber assemblies within biological cells. For this, we also incorporate the key biophysical elements that determine the dynamics of these assemblies, which include the polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their interactions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and hydrodynamic coupling. This work, to our knowledge, is the first technique to include many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HIs), and the resulting fluid flows, in cellular fiber assemblies. We use the non-local slender body theory to compute the fluid-structure interactions of the fibers and a second-kind boundary integral formulation for other rigid bodies and the confining boundary. A kernel-independent implementation of the fast multiple method is utilized for efficient evaluation of HIs. The deformation of the fibers is described by the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and their polymerization is modeled by the reparametrization of the dynamic equations in the appropriate non-Lagrangian frame. We use a pseudo-spectral representation of fiber positions and implicit HIs in the time-stepping to resolve large fiber deformations, and to allow time-steps not constrained by temporal stiffness or fiber-fiber interactions. The entire computational scheme is parallelized, which enables simulating assemblies of thousands of fibers. We use our method to investigate two important questions in the mechanics of cell division: (i) the effect of confinement on the hydrodynamic mobility of microtubule asters; and (ii) the dynamics of the positioning of mitotic spindle in complex cell geometries. Finally to demonstrate the general applicability of the method, we simulate the sedimentation of a cloud of fibers."

The key concept in our method is the piecewise-linear (PL) foliation, decomposing the mesh into one-dimensional submanifolds and reducing the mapping problem to parametrization of a lower-dimensional manifold (a foliation   section). The maps resulting from these foliations are proved to be   bijective and continuous, and shown to have   provably bijective PL approximations.

Though trivial for implicit representations, boolean operations are notoriously difficult to execute robustly for explicit boundary representations. Existing methods for 3D triangle meshes fall short in one way or another. Some methods are fast but fail to produce closed, self-intersection free output. Other methods are robust but place prohibitively strict assumptions on the input, e.g., no hollow cavities, non-manifold edges or selfintersections. We propose a systematic recipe for conducting a family of exact constructive solid geometry operations. The two-stage method makes no general position assumptions and does not resort to numerical perturbation. The method is variadic, operating on any number of input meshes. This generalizes unary mesh-repair operations, classic binary boolean differencing, and n-ary operations such as finding all regions inside at least k out of n inputs. We demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of our method on a dataset of 10,000 ""real-world"" meshes from a popular online repository. To encourage development, validation, and comparison, we release both our code and dataset to the public."

We describe how the TT decomposition can be used as a hierarchical compression and inversion scheme for matrices arising from the discretization of integral equations. For a broad range of problems, computational and storage costs of the inversion scheme are extremely modest O(logN) and once the inverse is computed, it can be applied in O(N logN). We analyze the TT ranks for hierarchically low rank matrices and discuss its relationship to commonly used hierarchical compression techniques such as FMM, HSS, and wavelets. We prove that the TT ranks are bounded for translation-invariant systems and argue that this behavior extends to non-translation invariant volume and boundary integrals. For volume integrals, the TT decomposition provides an efficient direct solver requiring significantly less memory compared to other fast direct solvers. We present results demonstrating the remarkable performance of the TT-based solver when applied to both translation and non-translation invariant volume integrals in 3D. For boundary integral equations, we demonstrate that using a TT decomposition to construct preconditioners for a Krylov subspace method leads to an efficient and robust solver with a small memory footprint. We test the TT preconditioners in the iterative solution of an exterior elliptic boundary value problem (Laplace) formulated as a boundary integral equation in complex, multiply connected geometries."

Our method is an extension of our previous work  to flows with viscosity contrast.This generalization requires a change in the boundary integral formulation of the solution, in which a double-layer Stokes integral is introduced, and leads to changes in the fluid dynamics due to the viscosity contrast of the vesicles, which can no longer be efficiently resolved with existing algorithms. In this paper we describe the algorithms needed to handle flows with viscosity contrast accurately and efficiently. We show that a globally semi-implicit method does not have any time-step stability constraint for flows with single and multiple vesicles with moderate viscosity contrast and the computational cost per simulation unit time is comparable to or less than that of an explicit scheme. Automatic oversampling adaptation enables us to achieve high accuracy with very low spectral resolution. We conduct numerical experiments to investigate the stability, accuracy, and the computational cost of the algorithms. Overall, our method achieves several orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the standard explicit schemes."

This pattern family can be printed without internal support structure on a single-material 3D printer and can be used to fabricate objects with prescribed mechanical behavior. The family can be extended easily to create anisotropic patterns with target orthotropic properties. We demonstrate that our elastic textures are able to achieve a user-supplied varying material property distribution. We also present a material optimization algorithm to choose material properties at each point within an object to best fit a target deformation under a prescribed scenario. We show that, by fabricating these spatially varying materials with elastic textures, the desired behavior is achieved."

For common geometric modeling tasks it is desirable  to retain the simplicity and flexibility of commonly used subdivision surfaces, and extend them to handle T-meshes. We propose a subdivision scheme extending Catmull-Clark and  NURSS to a special class of quad T-meshes, dyadic T-meshes, which have no more than one T-joint per edge.  Our scheme is based on a factorization with the same structure as Catmull-Clark subdivision. On regular T-meshes  it is a refinement scheme for a subset of standard T-splines.  While we use more variations of subdivision masks compared to  Catmull-Clark and NURSS, the minimal size of the stencil is maintained, and all variations in formulas are due to simple  changes in coefficients."

Technically, the solver is inspired by previously developed direct solvers for integral equations based on ""recursive skeletonization"" and ""Hierarchically Semi-Separable"" (HSS) matrices, but it improves on the asymptotic complexity of existing solvers by incorporating an additional level of compression. The resulting solver has optimal O(N) complexity for all stages of the computation, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical examples. The computational examples further display good practical performance in terms of both speed and memory usage. In particular, it is demonstrated that even problems involving 10^{7} unknowns can be solved to precision 10^{-10} using a simple Matlab implementation of the algorithm executed on a single core."

In order to represent the deformations well (in terms of a global metric), the basis functions usually have global support, and cannot capture localized deformations. While reduced-space basis functions can be localized to some extent, capturing truly local deformations would still require a very large number of precomputed basis functions, significantly degrading both precomputation and online performance. We present an efficient approach to handling local deformations that cannot be predicted, most commonly arising from contact and collisions, by augmenting the subspace basis with custom functions derived from analytic solutions to static loading problems. We also present a new cubature scheme designed to facilitate fast computation of the necessary runtime quantities while undergoing a changing basis. Our examples yield a two order of magnitude speedup over full-coordinate simulations, striking a desirable balance between runtime speeds and expressive ability."

Placement of cones plays a decisive role in determining the overall distortion of the parametrization; at the same time, feature and boundary alignment also affect the cone placement. A number of methods were proposed for automatic choice of cone positions, either based on singularities of cross-fields and emphasizing alignment, or based on distortion optimization. In this paper we describe a method for placing cones for seamless global parametrizations with alignment constraints. We use a close relation between variation-minimizing cross-fields and related 1-forms and conformal maps, and demonstrate how it leads to a constrained optimization problem formulation. We show for boundary-aligned parametrizations metric distortion may be reduced by cone chains, sometimes to an arbitrarily small value, and the trade-off between the distortion and the number of cones can be controlled by a regularization term. Constrained parametrizations computed using our method have significantly lower distortion compared to the state-of-the art field-based method, yet maintain feature and boundary alignment. In the most extreme cases, parametrization collapse due to alignment constraints is eliminated."

The development pipeline for such products is radically different from the conventional manufacturing pipeline: 3D geometric models are designed by users often with little or no manufacturing experience, and sent directly to the printer. Structural analysis on the user side with conventional tools is often unfeasible as it requires specialized training and software. Trial-and-error, the most common approach, is time-consuming and expensive. We present a method that would identify structural problems in objects designed for 3D printing based on geometry and material properties only, without specific assumptions on loads and manual load setup. We solve a constrained optimization problem to determine the ""worst"" load distribution for a shape that will cause high local stress or large deformations. While in its general form this optimization has a prohibitively high computational cost, we demonstrate that an approximate method makes it possible to solve the problem rapidly for a broad range of printed models. We validate our method both computationally and experimentally and demonstrate that it has good predictive power for a number of diverse 3D printed shapes."

They are smooth, preserve angles, and are locally injective by construction. However, conformal maps do not allow for boundary positions to be prescribed. A natural extension to the space of conformal maps is the richer space of quasiconformal maps of bounded conformal distortion. Extremal quasiconformal maps, that is, maps minimizing the maximal conformal distortion, have a number of appealing properties making them a suitable candidate for geometry processing tasks. Similarly to conformal maps, they are guaranteed to be locally bijective; unlike conformal maps however, extremal quasiconformal maps have sufficient flexibility to allow for solution of boundary value problems. Moreover, in practically relevant cases, these solutions are guaranteed to exist, are unique and have an explicit characterization.

Computing such global seamless parametrization makes it possible to perform quad remeshing, texture mapping and texture synthesis and many other types of geometry processing operations. Our approach is based on a formulation of the Poisson equation on a manifold structure defined for the surface by the range images. Construction of such global parametrization requires only a way to project surface data onto a set of planes, and can be applied directly to implicit surfaces, nonmanifold surfaces, very large meshes, and collections of range scans.

Our goal is the direct simulation of blood, which we model as a mixture of a Stokesian fluid (plasma) and red blood cells (RBCs). Directly simulating blood is a challenging multiscale, multiphysics problem. We report simulations with up to 200 million deformable RBCs. The largest simulation amounts to 90 billion unknowns in space. In terms of the number of cells, we improve the state-of-the art by several orders of magnitude: the previous largest simulation, at the same physical fidelity as ours, resolved the flow of O(1,000-10,000) RBCs. Our approach has three distinct characteristics: (1) we faithfully represent the physics of RBCs by using nonlinear solid mechanics to capture the deformations of each cell; (2) we accurately resolve the long-range, N-body, hydrodynamic interactions between RBCs (which are caused by the surrounding plasma); and (3) we allow for the highly non-uniform distribution of RBCs in space. The new method has been implemented in the software library MOBO (for ""Moving Boundaries""). We designed MOBO to support parallelism at all levels, including inter-node distributed memory parallelism, intra-node shared memory parallelism, data parallelism (vectorization), and fine-grained multithreading for GPUs. We have implemented and optimized the majority of the computation kernels on both Intel/AMD x86 and NVidia's Tesla/Fermi platforms for single and double floating point precision. Overall, the code has scaled on 256 CPU-GPUs on the Teragrid's Lincoln cluster and on 200,000 AMD cores of the Oak Ridge national Laboratory's Jaguar PF system. In our largest simulation, we have achieved 0.7 Petaflops/s of sustained performance on Jaguar."

A number of recent algorithms for conversion of arbitrary meshes to regularly sampled form (typically quadrangulation) aim to align the resulting mesh with feature lines of the geometry. While resulting in a substantial improvement in mesh quality, feature alignment makes it difficult to obtain coarse regular patch partitions of the mesh. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing patch layouts consisting of small numbers of quadrilateral patches while maintaining good feature alignment. To achieve this, we use quadrilateral T-meshes, for which the intersection of two faces may not be the whole edge or vertex, but a part of an edge. T-meshes offer more flexibility for reduction of the number of patches and vertices in a base domain while maintaining alignment with geometric features. At the same time, T-meshes retain many desirable features of quadrangulations, allowing construction of high-order representations, easy packing of regularly sampled geometric data into textures, as well as supporting different types of discretizations for physical simulation."

For example, high-quality C2 surfaces that obey boundary conditions on positions, tangents and curvatures can be conveniently defined as solutions of high-order geometric PDEs; the advantage of such a formulation is its conceptual representation-independence. In practice, solving high-order problems efficiently and accurately for surfaces approximated by meshes is notoriously difficult. For modeling applications, the preferred approach is to use discrete geometric schemes which are efficient and robust, but their convergence properties are less well understood compared to higher-order FEM. In this paper, we explore discretizations of common geometric PDEs on meshes using mixed finite elements, where additional variables for the derivatives in the problem are introduced. Such formulations use first-order derivatives only, allowing a discretization with simple linear elements. Various boundary conditions can be naturally discretized in this setting. We formalize continuous region constraints commonly used in modeling applications, and show that these seamlessly fit into the mixed framework. We demonstrate that some of the commonly used discrete geometric discretizations can be regarded as a particular case of mixed finite elements. We study the convergence behavior of our discretizations, and how they can be applied to implement common modeling tasks."

Most existing techniques rely on global parametrization methods either producing uniform aspect-ratio quads, or anisotropic quads with sizes unrelated to the curvature magnitudes. We propose a simple technique that can be combined with a variety of parametrization and quadrangulation methods to produce anisotropic semiregular remeshing. Our approach is based on using a metric derived from the shape operator to adjust lengths and angles in surface parametrization equations in a way that equalizes normal error distribution over the surface."

On traditional CPU-only systems, our implementation scales well up to 30 billion unknowns on 65K cores (AMD/CRAY-based Kraken system at NSF/NICS) for highly non-uniform point distributions. On GPU-enabled systems, we achieve 30x speedup for problems of up to 256 million points on 256 GPUs (Lincoln at NSF/NCSA) over a comparable CPU-only based implementations. We achieve scalability to such extreme core counts by adopting a new approach to scalable MPI-based tree construction and partitioning, and a new reduction algorithm for the evaluation phase. For the sub-components of the evaluation phase (the direct- and approximate-interactions, the target evaluation, and the source-to-multipole translations), we use NVIDIA's CUDA framework for GPU acceleration to achieve excellent performance. To do so requires carefully constructed data structure transformations, which we describe in the paper and whose cost we show is minor.

We use a boundary integral formulation for the fluid that results in a set of nonlinear integro-differential equations for the vesicle dynamics. The motion of the vesicles is determined by balancing the nonlocal hydrodynamic forces with the elastic forces due to bending and tension. Numerical simulations of such vesicle motions are quite challenging. On one hand, explicit time-stepping schemes suffer from a severe stability constraint due to the stiffness related to high-order spatial derivatives and a milder constraint due to a transport-like stability condition. On the other hand, an implicit scheme can be expensive because it requires the solution of a set of nonlinear equations at each time step.  We present two semi-implicit schemes that circumvent the severe stability constraints on the time step and whose computational cost per time step is comparable to that of an explicit scheme. We discretize the equations by using a spectral method in space, and a multistep third-order accurate scheme in time. We use the fast multipole method (FMM) to efficiently compute vesicle-vesicle interaction forces in a suspension with a large number of vesicles.

While it is possible to remove topological and geometric noise as a post-processing step, in the case when a large number of isolines are of interest there is a considerable advantage in filtering the scalar function directly. While most smoothing filters result in gradual simplification of the topological structure of contours, new topological features typically emerge and disappear during the smoothing process.

We propose a simple and efficient formulation for the shape operator for variational problems on general meshes, using degrees of freedom associated with normals. On the one hand, it is similar in its simplicity to some of the discrete curvature operators commonly used in graphics; on the other hand, it passes a number of important convergence tests and produces consistent results for different types of meshes and mesh refinement."

The texture is regarded as a piece of stretchable material, which the user can position and deform on the surface, selecting arbitrary sets of constraints and mapping texture points to the surface; in addition, the multi-touch input makes it possible to specify natural handles for texture manipulation using point constraints associated with different fingers. Pressure can be used as a direct interface for texture combination operations. The 3D position of the object and its texture can be manipulated simultaneously using two-hand input."

As a result of noise and other artifacts, curves and surfaces obtained by standard extraction algorithms often suffer from topological irregularities and geometric noise. While it is possible to remove topological and geometric noise as a post-processing step, in the case when a large number of isolines are of interest there is a considerable advantage in filtering the scalar function directly. While most smoothing filters result in gradual simplification of the topological structure of contours, new topological features typically emerge and disappear during the smoothing process.

Both types of approaches have found applications in geometric modeling. While there is a well-established theory for finite element methods, alternative discretizations are less well understood: many questions about mesh dependence, convergence and accuracy remain unanswered. We discuss the general principles for defining curvaturebased energy on discrete surfaces based on geometric invariance and convergence considerations. We show how these principles can be used to understand the behavior of some commonly used discretizations, to establish relations between some well-known discrete geometry and finite element formulations and to derive new simple and efficient discretizations."

To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels.

We embed the domain in a rectangular domain, for which fast solvers are available, and we impose the boundary conditions as interface (jump) conditions on the velocities and tractions. We use an indirect boundary integral formulation for the homogeneous Stokes equations to compute the jumps. The resulting equations are discretized by Nystrom's method. The rectangular domain problem is discretized by finite elements for a velocity-pressure formulation with equal order interpolation bilinear elements (Q1-Q1). Stabilization is used to circumvent the inf-sup condition for the pressure space. For the integral equations, fast matrix-vector multiplications are achieved via an N log N algorithm based on a block representation of the discrete integral operator, combined with (kernel independent) singular value decomposition to sparsity low-rank blocks.

The crucial advantage of the proposed scheme is that it uses bisection refinement as an elementary refinement operation, rather than more commonly used face or vertex splits. In the uniform case, bisection refinement results in doubling, rather than quadrupling of the number of faces in a mesh. Adaptive bisection refinement automatically generates conforming variable-resolution meshes in contrast to face and vertex split methods which require a postprocessing step to make an adaptively refined mesh conforming. The fact that the size of faces decreases more gradually with refinement allows one to have greater control over the resolution of a refined mesh. It also makes it possible to achieve higher smoothness while using small stencils (the size of the stencils used by our scheme is similar to Loop subdivision). We show that the subdivision surfaces produced by the 4-8 scheme are C-4 continuous almost everywhere, except at extraordinary vertices where they are is C-1-continuous."

The scheme of Catmull-Clark is an example of the former, while the Doo-Sabin scheme exemplifies the latter. In this paper we consider the construction of an increasing sequence of alternating primal/dual quadrilateral subdivision schemes based on a simple averaging approach. Beginning with a vertex split step we successively construct variants of Doo-Sabin and Catmull-Clark schemes followed by novel schemes generalizing B-splines of bidegree up to nine. We prove the schemes to be C-1 at irregular surface points, and analyze the behavior of the schemes as the number of averaging steps increases. We discuss a number of implementation issues common to all quadrilateral schemes. In particular we show how both primal and dual quadrilateral schemes can be implemented in the same code, opening up new possibilities for more flexible geometric modeling applications and p-versions of the Subdivision Element Method. Additionally we describe a simple algorithm for adaptive subdivision of dual schemes."

Aided Geom. Design, 12 (1995), pp. 153-174.] and extended to a more general setting in [Denis Zorin, Constr. Approx., accepted for publication]. In both cases, the analysis of C-1-continuity is reduced to establishing injectivity and regularity of a characteristic map. In all known proofs of C-1-continuity, explicit representation of the limit surface on an annular region was used to establish regularity, and a variety of relatively complex techniques were used to establish injectivity. We propose a new approach to this problem: we show that for a general class of subdivision schemes, regularity can be inferred from the properties of a sufficiently close linear approximation, and injectivity can be veri ed by computing the index of a curve. An additional advantage of our approach is that it allows us to prove C-1-continuity for all valences of vertices, rather than for an arbitrarily large but finite number of valences. As an application, we use our method to analyze C-1-continuity of most stationary subdivision schemes known to us, including interpolating butterfly and modified butterfly schemes, as well as the Kobbelt's interpolating scheme for quadrilateral meshes."

In this view, subdivision algorithms effectively bridge the gap between patchbased and polygonal mesh representations. Using subdivision also naturally leads to useful multiresolution representations of surfaces. Such representations can be used for a variety of applications, most importantly, interactive editing and animation. We found that such representations are equally applicable for construction of models from scratch as well as manipulation of scanned high-resolution geometry data. In our ongoing work we are addressing a few important research problems that have to be solved to make such applications practical. Currently our research is focused on two major issues: the design of efficient algorithms for manipulation of subdivision-based multiresolution surfaces and development of algorithms for fitting of meshes with subdivision connectivity to unorganized surface samples. In this paper we discuss our approach to these problems, compare them to the related work, and demonstrate results."

Of particular interest are interpolating schemes since they match the original data exactly, and play an important role in fast multiresolution and wavelet techniques. Dyn, Gregory, and Levin introduced the Butterfly scheme, which yields C1 surfaces in the topologically regular setting. Unfortunately it exhibits undesirable artifacts in the case of an irregular topology. We examine these failures and derive an improved scheme, which retains the simplicity of the Butterfly scheme, is interpolating, and results in smoother surfaces."

From a small set of simple assumptions we obtain perceptually preferable viewing transformations and show that these transformations can be decomposed into a perspective or parallel projection followed by a planar transformation. The decomposition is easily implemented and provides a convenient framework for further analysis of the image mapping. We prove that two perceptually important properties are incompatible and cannot be satisfied simultaneously. It is impossible to construct a viewing transformation such that the images of all lines are straight and the images of all spheres are exact circles. Perceptually preferable tradeoffs between these two types of distortions can depend on the content of the picture. We construct parametric families of transformations with parameters representing the relative importance of the perceptual characteristics. By adjusting the settings of the parameters we canminimize the overall distortion of the picture. It turns out that a simple family of transformations produces results that are sufficiently close to optimal.
